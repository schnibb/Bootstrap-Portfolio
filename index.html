                    My name is David Schnibben. I am 32 years old and currently work with a local school district in their IT department. I graduated from the University of South Carolina with a Bachelors Degree in Criminology and Criminal Justice. After college I worked
                    as a Police Officer in South Carolina for approximately 6 and a half years. During my time in law enforcement I met my wife and we were married. We have been married for 5 years now and have one child who is 10 months old.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My wife and I moved to Georgia for my wifeâ€™s job and at that time I decided to change career paths, as law enforcement was not exactly the best and safest career for a new family. I started my IT career with UPS as a field technician in the Savannah GA
                    area. After more than a year with UPS I transitioned to a school district where I would be able to grow with their young staff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have always enjoyed web development and took my first class back in college, but I did not give it the attention it deserved then, or maybe I would have found my passion way back when. I have taught myself most of what I know to this point. I have experience
                    in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, PHP and MySQL. I hope that this course will strengthen my knowledge base of what I have already started to study, and give me the knowledge and experience to take my career to the next level.
